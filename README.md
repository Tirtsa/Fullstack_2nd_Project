# Fullstack_2nd_Project - Gaming web application 

## Introduction
Welcome to my second fullstack application project! This project is a dynamic and interactive game website designed to enhance my skills in web development. This project not only focuses on creating an engaging game but also implements user account management, local storage for data persistence, and extensive use of JavaScript for both functionality and styling.

## Project Overview
In this game website, users can create accounts, log in, and save their progress using local storage. The application is built using HTML and CSS for the basic structure and layout, while JavaScript is utilized extensively to handle game logic, user interactions, and dynamic styling.

## Key Features
- **User Accounts:** Users can sign up, log in, and maintain their profiles.
- **Local Storage:** Persistent storage of user data, game progress, and settings.
- **Interactive Game Logic:** JavaScript-driven game mechanics providing an engaging user experience.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Use of JavaScript to dynamically update and manipulate CSS styles for responsive and interactive UI elements.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS:** For basic styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For game logic, dynamic content updates, and styling.
- **Local Storage:** For storing user data and game progress locally in the browser.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
- **Enhancing JavaScript Skills:** Deepen understanding of JavaScript by building interactive game mechanics and dynamic styling.
- **Implementing User Authentication:** Learn to manage user accounts and store user data.
